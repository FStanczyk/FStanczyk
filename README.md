### Hello!

My passion is Blockchain technology and introducing it to everyday life. I would like to participate in providing modern and easily accessible solutions with the use of Web3. I started pragramming from C++ 2 years ago. Switched mostly to Solidity a year before. Now I am able write dapps with Javascript (Typescript also but not that well), React, Solidity, Hardhat, Brownie, Ethers.js and UseDapp. 

Currently working on Autonomous Market Maker in solidity (Uniswapv3 like). Learning about Constant Product Formula, liquidity pools and sharestake'ing.

Beside that I am constantly learning Solidity, Javascript / Typescript, React, Python and C++ as well as frameworks such as hardhat, Ethers or UseDapp.

At the moment I am working on some Solidity projects and Javascript+React workout planner;

I would like to collaborate in some Web3 projects. 

Feel free to contact me at Email: stanczyk.fs@gmail.com
