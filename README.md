### Hello!

My name is Filip Stańczyk.
Blockchain technology and introducing it to everyday lifeis my passion. I would like to participate in providing modern and easily accessible solutions with the use of Web3.

I am currently learning Solidity, Javascript / Typescript, React, Python and C++ as well as frameworks such as Brownie, Ethers or UseDapp.

At the moment I am working on a project similar to NFT.

I would like to collaborate in some Web3 projects. 

Feel free to contact me at Email: fs.stanczyk@gmail.com
